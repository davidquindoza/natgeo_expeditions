<p class = "faq" align = "justify">ADVENTURE TRAVEL BUILT ON AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGACY OF EXPLORATION


For more than 130 years, National Geographic has sent its scientists, storytellers, and adventurers across continents and into remote cultures in an effort to better understand our planet and its people. National Geographic Expeditions grew from this legacy as a way to invite others to explore—to encounter the wonders of the world up close, in-depth, right at the source, and to be transformed by the experience. <br>
<br>
National Geographic Expeditions offers premium travel experiences that embody the renowned National Geographic spirit of adventure, conservation and education. When you travel with us, you gain access to unique people and places. You’re enriched by the knowledge of certified National Geographic experts and guides, and by local experts we meet along the way. And you give back. Simply by taking a trip with National Geographic, you support the work of our explorers and researchers.<br>
<br>
We operate hundreds of trips each year, spanning all seven continents and visiting more than 80 destinations. Our trips are curated to reflect our travellers’ broad spectrum of interests. We travel on land, aboard small ships and along classic train routes, and we furthermore offer special trips for photographers, families and independent travellers. Our expeditions offer boundless opportunities to be surrounded by natural wonders and exotic wildlife, to explore celebrated archaeological sites, to learn about different cultures and share in local traditions.<br>
<br>
Driven by a spirit of curiosity, our guests travel with us to enjoy an unforgettable voyage, to discover the planet’s natural beauty, and to meet its inhabitants. This experience is an extraordinary opportunity to expand one’s horizons, and upon returning, to share that wonder and emphasise the need to protect the environment.<br>
<br>
By travelling with us you become part of National Geographic.<br>
