<h3>Patrick says:</h3>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify"><q>Nat Geo have provided the best trips I have taken with a group. They've taken me off the beaten path, provided outstanding educational experiences in small groups to places not often offered by other groups.</p>

<h3>Mark says:</h3>

<h3>Johnny says:</h3>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify"><q>We just returned from an amazing experience exploring the Galapagos Islands then following up with another awesome week in Peru -- highlighted by touring the ruins of Machu Picchu. The naturalists, local guides and expedition leaders were outstanding! We'll be talking about this trip for years. This was our first experience with National Geographic Expeditions and loved it so much we've already made reservations for our next trip!</p>

<h3>Cathy says:</h3>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify"><q>The travel by private jet etc. that is being promoted and appears on my Facebook feed of late has an irresponsibly large carbon footprint. We can’t go on with business as usual. Shame on you NatGeo.</p>

<h3>Mel says:</h3>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify"><q>I have done 2 going on my third next year. They are well organized all you have to do is a good time. They give choices. of activites each day, Hotels and ships are top of the line. and food is gourmet. You meet wonderful people, the Nat Geo personnel are great nd take care of everything.</p>

<h3>Jackie says:</h3>
<p class = "faq" align = "justify"><q>I have loved every trip I have taken. I especially liked the voyage up the west African coast and Antarctica. Baltic Sea was full of surprises. Photographers, naturalists, historians and specialists are the best. Special kudos to Tom Richie, Jim Kelley, Lisa, and others who have shared special memories with me.</p>
